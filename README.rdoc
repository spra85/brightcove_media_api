THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT

This gem provides an additional object wrapper around David Czarnecki's Ruby-MAPI-Wrapper.  To set-up:

BrightcoveConfig.configuration_files = config.yml # Set to YAML file location, example YML:

brightcove_account:
  account_id: 123456789
  read_tokens:
    - read_token1
  url_read_tokens:
    - url_read_token1
  write_tokens:
    - write_token1
    - write_token2
    - write_token3

To configure logger, example:

Brightcove::API::Request.logger = Lumberjack.new(log_file_path, :device => Lumberjack::Device::DateRollingLogFile)

== Contributing to brightcove_media_api

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
